In this post are listed the naming schemes of popular basis sets that can be found in [Basis Set Exchange program](https://www.basissetexchange.org/) and [CRYSTAL basis set webpage](https://www.crystal.unito.it/basis-sets.php). Basis sets developed for pseudopotentials are not included in this post, since CRYSTAL code is more commonly used for more accurate all-electron calculations. The correctness of this page are regularly inspected.
